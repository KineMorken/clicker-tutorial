Can buy unicorns.
They drop down from above, and bounce around with various heights (and a slow forward movement). Occasionall very tall bounce.

These function as a permanent upgrade.



Can later buy dragons.

These fly about, often out of view, suddenly enormously floating by in the background (in front of the sun, behind any clouds).

Later-stage permanent upgrade. 



Late-game:
(Or very rare, ad-spin reward)
Floating giant pink whale
